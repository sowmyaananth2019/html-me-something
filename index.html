        <p>Niagara Falls is three waterfalls that straddle the international border between the
             Canadian province of Ontario and the US state of New York. They form the southern end
              of the Niagara Gorge. From largest to smallest, the three waterfalls are the Horseshoe 
              Falls, American Falls and the Bridal Veil Falls.</p>

              <h2>Horseshoe Falls</h2>
              Horseshoe falls, also known as Canadian falls, is the largest of the three
              waterfalls that collectively form Niagara Falls. Approximately 90% of the 
              Niagara River flows over Horseshoe Falls. It is located between Terrapin 
              point on Goat Island in the US state of Newyork, and Tablerock in the 
              Canadian province of Ontario.

            <h2>American Falls</h2>
            <p> The American Falls is the second-largest of the three waterfalls that 
            together are known as Niagara Falls. Unlike the much larger Horseshoe Falls,
            of which two-thirds is in Ontario, Canada and one-third in the US State of 
            New york, the American Falls is entirely within the United States.</p>

            <h2>Bridal Veil Falls</h2>
            <p> The Bridal Veil Falls is the smallest of the three waterfalls that make
              up Niagara Falls. It is located on the American side (in New York State);
               Luna Island separates it from the American Falls and Goat Island separates 
               it from the Horseshoe Falls.</p>

               <h2>Fun Fact</h2>             

              <p>Did you know that Niagara Falls is not the tallest waterfall in the world?
                There are about 500 other waterfalls in the world that are “taller” than Niagara.
                 The Angel Falls in Venezuela stands at 979 metres (3,212 ft.).
                  What makes Niagara Falls so impressive is the amount of water flowing over.
                   Most of the tallest falls in the world have very little water flowing over them.
                    It’s the combination of height and volume that makes Niagara Falls so breathtaking.
