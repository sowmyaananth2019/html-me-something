        <p>Niagara Falls is three waterfalls that straddle the international border between the<br>
             Canadian province of Ontario and the US state of New York. They form the southern end<br>
              of the Niagara Gorge. From largest to smallest, the three waterfalls are the Horseshoe <br>
              Falls…</p>

              <h2>Horseshoe Falls</h2>
              Horseshoe falls, also known as Canadian falls, is the largest of the three<br>
              waterfalls that collectively form Niagara Falls. Approximately 90% of the <br>
              Niagara River flows over Horseshoe Falls. It is located between Terrapin <br>
              point on Goat Island in the US state of Newyork, and Tablerock in the <br>
              Canadian province of Ontario.

            <h2>American Falls</h2>
            <p>The American Falls is the second-largest of the three waterfalls that <br>
            together are known as Niagara Falls. Unlike the much larger Horseshoe Falls,<br>
            of which two-thirds is in Ontario, Canada and one-third in the US State of <br>
            New york, the American Falls is entirely within the United States.</p>

            <h2>Bridal Veil Falls</h2>
            <p>he Bridal Veil Falls is the smallest of the three waterfalls that make<br>
              up Niagara Falls. It is located on the American side (in New York State);<br>
               Luna Island separates it from the American Falls and Goat Island separates <br>
               it from the Horseshoe Falls.</p>

               <h3>Fun Fact</h3>             

              <p>Did you know that Niagara Falls is not the tallest waterfall in the world?<br>
                There are about 500 other waterfalls in the world that are “taller” than Niagara.<br>
                 The Angel Falls in Venezuela stands at 979 metres (3,212 ft.).<br>
                  What makes Niagara Falls so impressive is the amount of water flowing over.<br>
                   Most of the tallest falls in the world have very little water flowing over them.<br>
                    It’s the combination of height and volume that makes Niagara Falls so breathtaking.
